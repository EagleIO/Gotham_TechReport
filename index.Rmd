This is a technical report that contains the development of the Eagle IO Engagement survey.

This survey is intentionally complex in terms of item and scale associations. There are three substantive engagement dimensions as well as three attitudinal dimensions: 

| Substantive    | Attitudinal   |
|----------------|---------------|
| Dedication     | Affective     |
| Absorption     | Behavioral    |
| Vigor          | Cognitive     |

The feedback report uses the terms, "feel", "do", and "think" instead of the Psychological literature-based affect, behavior, and cognition [see, for example, @eagly_psychology_1993].
