Instructions asked each rater to: INSTRUCTIONS: Place an “X” in the column that you feel is the best fit for each item (only one “X” per row please) The substantive scale definitions provided for ratings were: Absorption: Being fully immersed in one’s work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks Vigor: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working Dedication: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization The attitudinal scale definitions were: Cognitive: Pertaining to thoughts or general mental processes (for example what someone thinks) Affective: Pertaining to feelings or emotions (for example, how someone feels) Behavioral: Pertaining to acts or actions (for example, what someone does) The goal was to identify item(s) that were equally and heavily implicated with one substantive and one attitudinal scale.
