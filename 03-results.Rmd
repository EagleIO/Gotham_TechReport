## Pilot

The pilot administrations consisted of 36 [items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KYE7jq8XLhN-mfGQRMnkf5AM-_U2CJck50eISbAiwM/edit?usp=sharing) that were presented in one of four administration groupings (see Appendix \@ref(pilot2)): 1) within substantive dimension (attitudinally grouped [but randomized within blocks of 4]), 2) within attitudinal dimension (substantively grouped [but randomized within blocks of 4]), 3) within substantive dimension (randomly distributed by attitude), and 4) within attitudinal dimension (randomly presented by substance).[^footie]

The four "experimental" conditions therefore prioritized and reflected the 3x3 groupings *or* one of the organization schemes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral *or* dedication, absorption, and vigor).
 
[^footie]: Decision was made on 10/13 to have the order of presentation *randomized* within each of the broader organization blocks (for example, Condition 3: all Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Absorption items were randomly administered, then all ABC Dedication items, etc [although DAC was also randomized by block such that not every respondent had the same DAC ordering])

We chose to control the order of item administration because of our *a priori* specification of a bi-factor structure, with the expectation that item ordering would serve as a response cue, yeilding stronger factor structural support based on the organization scheme. 

### Sampling strategy (pilot)

Snowball sampling to reduce final instrument from 36 candidate items (4 per "cell"). 

Sampling plan (aim for 250 total responses):

+ Eagle I.O members reach out via e-mail - draft e-mail that asks to forward along.
+ facebook post (MSU I.O)
+ LinkedIn (put on next agenda)
+ first-year students (Paulina posts in group-chat)
    + mentors also mention to mentees
    + contact lists from Catrina

## Demographic Information

These are to be included in future administrations in an attempt to develop marketable norms:

+ employees who work overtime vs. those who do not
+ employees who get paid for overtime vs. those who don't receive compensation for extra hours worked[^nother]

[^nother]:I was thinking about this because at my job I have been working 12+ hours some days yet I do not get overtime pay. Not sure if this would work for what we are doing and I know my work experiences are not universal (nor should they be) haha!

## Construct and Criterion-related Validation

Use Gallup for construct validation [@thackray_gallup_2005]. Also the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [UWES; @schaufeli_measurement_2002; @schaufeli_defining_2010]
