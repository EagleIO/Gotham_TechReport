## Pilot

The pilot administrations consisted of 36 [items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18KYE7jq8XLhN-mfGQRMnkf5AM-_U2CJck50eISbAiwM/edit?usp=sharing) that were presented in one of four administration groupings (see Appendix \@ref(pilot2)): 1) within substantive dimension (attitudinally grouped [but randomized within blocks of 4]), 2) within attitudinal dimension (substantively grouped [but randomized within blocks of 4]), 3) within substantive dimension (randomly distributed by attitude), and 4) within attitudinal dimension (randomly presented by substance).[^footie]

The four "experimental" conditions therefore prioritized and reflected the 3x3 groupings *or* one of the organization schemes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral *or* dedication, absorption, and vigor).
 
[^footie]: Decision was made on 10/13 to have the order of presentation *randomized* within each of the broader organization blocks (for example, Condition 3: all Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Absorption items were randomly administered, then all ABC Dedication items, etc [although DAC was also randomized by block such that not every respondent had the same DAC ordering])

We chose to control the order of item administration because of our *a priori* specification of a bi-factor structure, with the expectation that item ordering would serve as a response cue, yielding stronger factor structural support based on the organization scheme. 

### Sampling strategy (pilot)

The sampling strategy will consist of Snowball or Referral Sampling to reduce the final instrument from 36 items (4 per "cell") to 18 items (2 per "cell"). Our aim is to obtain about 250 total responses viable for analysis. A Confirmatory Bi-Factor Analysis will be performed to determine the best candidate items for the final assessment. The launch was informed by research looking at different "days of the week" and their effectiveness regarding response rate. This was both [commercial](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/best-time-send-survey) as well as academic [e.g., @stone_dayweek_2012].

Sampling plan:
Eagle I.O members will be in charge of the distribution of the Engagement survey.An email will be drafted asking participants to take the survey and forward it to family and friends who qualify as participants.They will reach out to other students, alumni, friends, and family through the following:

+ Facebook post on MSU group page 
+ LinkedIn profiles of all Eagle I.O members 
+ Email first and second year students directly
+ Email MSU alumni directly (most recent 2020 graduates)
+ Email professors in the Psychology department
+ Mentors will reach out to mentees individually 
+ Survey will be posted on Eagle I.O webpage
   
   

## Demographic Information

These are to be included in future administrations in an attempt to develop marketable norms:

+ Employees who work overtime vs. those who do not
+ Employees who get paid for overtime vs. those who don't receive compensation for extra hours worked[^nother]

[^nother]:I was thinking about this because at my job I have been working 12+ hours some days yet I do not get overtime pay. Not sure if this would work for what we are doing and I know my work experiences are not universal (nor should they be) haha!

## Construct and Criterion-related Validation

Use Gallup for construct validation [@thackray_gallup_2005]. Also the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [UWES; @schaufeli_measurement_2002; @schaufeli_defining_2010]
